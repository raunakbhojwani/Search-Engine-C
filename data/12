<p>In Computer Science 50 you will learn how to design &amp; build large,  reliable, maintainable, and understandable software systems.  In the process you will learn to program in C with Unix development tools.</p>

<p>In other words, you’ll learn to be a hacker! Yes, a hacker, in the original sense of the word as defined by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983">RFC1983 The Internet Users’ Glossary</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other common use of the term hacker is actually a mistake and should instead be “cracker”, which is defined by the same source as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A cracker is an individual who attempts to access computer systems without authorization.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We won’t be learning about <em>cracking</em> in CS50. If you want to learn about that, then you should take <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ccpalmer/classes/cs55/Content/Purpose.html">CS55 Security &amp; Privacy</a>.</p>

<p>The first few weeks of this course are a crash course in Unix and C.  After that, you’ll build your very own Search Engine application.  Finally, you’ll join a team of other students to design, build, document, and test a large software project.</p>
